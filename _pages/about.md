I am a Ph.D. candidate in political science at Yale University. I study leadership, cooperation, and the politics of diplomacy at the international and domestic levels. My research has been published at the <i>American Political Science Review</i> and <i>The Journal of Politics</i>.

Other than international politics, I like watching the San Francisco Giants, cooking, and hanging out with my wife, daughter, and dog.
