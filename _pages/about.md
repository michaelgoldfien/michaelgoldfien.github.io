I am an assistant professor in the National Security Affairs department at the U.S. Naval War College. My research focuses on leadership and the domestic politics of foreign policy.  My work has appeared in the <i>American Political Science Review</i>, <i>Journal of Conflict Resolution</i>, <i>Security Studies</i>, and <i>The Journal of Politics</i>. I earned my Ph.D. in political science from Yale University in 2023.

Other than international politics, I like watching the San Francisco Giants, cooking, and hanging out with my wife, daughter, and dog.
