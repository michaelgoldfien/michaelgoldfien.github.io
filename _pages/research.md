<b> "The Domestic Sources of International Reputation" (with Michael Joseph and Roseanne McManus). Accepted at the <i>American Political Science Review</i>. <a href= "https://michaelgoldfien.github.io/files/GJM_Domestic_Reputation_Main_Doc.pdf">Paper</a> and <a href= "https://michaelgoldfien.github.io/files/GJM_Domestic_Reputation_Appendix.pdf">appendix</a>.</b>

<b>Abstract:</b> Existing research finds that leaders develop international reputations based on their past behavior on the international stage. We argue that leaders' domestic choices can also influence their international reputations, perhaps as much as their past foreign policy decisions do. Using formal theory and intuitive argumentation, we develop an overarching framework to predict how much any domestic choice will affect a leader's international reputation. We theorize that certain domestic choices can inform expectations about future international crisis behavior based on the extent to which (1) the costs at state are similar to those of an international crisis and (2) the domestic issue is salient relative to foreign policy. We use conjoint experiments and other evidence to show that many domestic choices have significant international reputational effects. There is some evidence that the reputational effect of certain domestic choices may equal that of fighting in a previous international crisis.

<b>"Public Opinion and Nuclear Use: Evidence from Factorial Experiments" (with Tyler Bowen and Matt Graham). Accepted at <i>The Journal of Politics</i>. <a href= "https://michaelgoldfien.github.io/files/BowenGoldfienGraham.pdf">Paper</a> and <a href= "https://michaelgoldfien.github.io/files/BowenGoldfienGraham_appendix.pdf">appendix</a>.</b> 

<b>Abstract:</b> Does the public oppose nuclear use? Survey experimental research varying either the advantages or disadvantages of nuclear use has produced a wide range of results. Yet no study has examined how the military advantages and strategic and moral disadvantages of nuclear weapons interact. We explore this interaction and uncover a pattern that unifies the literature's seemingly disparate results: the persuasive power of nuclear weapons' military advantages is conditional on their disadvantages. We demonstrate this by independently randomizing both the advantages and disadvantages of nuclear use in  (1) a 2x2 factorial version of an influential design and (2) a novel adaptation of conjoint experiments that focuses on the most plausible comparisons between nuclear and conventional strikes. Our results support a new explanation for why the public can appear rigidly opposed to nuclear strikes in some circumstances and highly permissive in others.
